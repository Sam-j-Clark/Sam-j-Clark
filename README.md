### Welcome

My name is Sam Clark and I am a Software engineering student. My goal with my Github account is not only to share my proudest work, but also to share some of the projects I produced along the way on my Software Engineering journey.

Projects that have been 'completed' will typically have my post mortem thoughts on them. This includes my key learnings and a brief reflection containing my thoughts on the project. My aim with this is to draw a picture of learnings and progress on my Software Engineering journey.
